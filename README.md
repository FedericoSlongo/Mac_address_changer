# Mac_address_changer
This is a simple mac address changer writen in c for linux    
This program will not work in windows
  
  Right now I'm about at 2/3 of the project  
  The network gets put down  
  and the address gets changed  
   
If the program exits whit a 1 it's not running in root mode  
If the program exits whit a 2 the mac address is not valid
