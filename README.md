# Mac_address_changer
This is a simple mac address changer writen in c for linux    
**This program will not work in windows**
  
  Right now the program should work but i have not yet tested it
   
If the program exits whit a 1 it's not running in root mode  
If the program exits whit a 2 the mac address is not valid
